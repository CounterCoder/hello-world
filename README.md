First repository lesson in IST 402
Response piece:
In my video, I mostly speak on the cycle of making a pull request and why it helps with group work. I tend to focus on how it would help in a workplace/business setting, and take it through step by step with examples on why each step is important and useful to all members of the group. I used our own class directory on how to make a pull request as my basis, but used my own examples and explanations to make it my own- and hopefully make it more understandable to someone who knows nothing about coding or It projects.
